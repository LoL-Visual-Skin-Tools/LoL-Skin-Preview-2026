# League of Legends Skin Preview 2026 – Visual Skinchanger for Skins and Chromas

League of Legends features a large and constantly expanding collection of
champion skins, chromas, and cosmetic variants, but previewing different visual
styles can be limited by availability, store rotation, or inventory access.

League of Legends Skin Preview 2026 is a visual-only skinchanger designed to
help users inspect champion skins, chromas, and cosmetic appearances locally,
without modifying gameplay mechanics, ranked systems, or online matches.

This project focuses on visual reference, cosmetic exploration, and content
creation workflows such as screenshots and videos. All changes are temporary
and applied client-side for preview purposes only.
